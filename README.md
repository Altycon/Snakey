        # Snakey
        
        This is my attempt to re-make the old snake game. It seems to be something that beginner programmers learn.
        I noticed it early on but it never interested me. But, I decided to give it a shot. With a quick look at a video 
        on youtube (Coding Train Snake Game) just to see how someone might even begin doing it, I realized quickly
        that I did not want to build it the same way. It seems that the 'grid' and/or 'block'** implementation of this game is
        a beginning but I decided to allow any path. This at first turned out to be way harder than I expected but at this point
        I think I have found a way and understand it enough to attempt to over engineer this.

        ** grid/block - here I mean breaking the canvas up into a blocked grid and only move the snake each block along 
                the grid.
